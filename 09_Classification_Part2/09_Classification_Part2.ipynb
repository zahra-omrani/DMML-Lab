    "## The *Data Leakage* pitfall ([docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/common_pitfalls.html#data-leakage))\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage occurs when information that would not be available at prediction time is used when building the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This results in overly optimistic performance estimates, for example from cross-validation, and thus poorer performance when the model is used on actually novel data, for example during production. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common cause is not keeping the test and train data subsets separate. **Test data should never be used to make choices about the model**. The general rule is to never call `fit` on the test data.\n",
    "Note that the same considerations apply for cross-validation, which can be viewed as an iteration of train-test splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The *Inconsistent Preprocessing* pitfall ([docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/common_pitfalls.html#inconsistent-preprocessing))\n",
    "\n",
    "Both train and test data subsets should receive the same preprocessing transformation: if data transformation operations (normalization, unsupervised dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, ...)  are used when training a model, they also must be used on subsequent datasets, whether it’s test data or data in a production system. Otherwise, the feature space will change, and the model will not be able to perform effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that these transformations are only learnt from the training data. For example, if you have a normalization step where you divide by the average value, the average should be the average of the train subset, not the average of all the data. If the test subset is included in the average calculation, information from the test subset is influencing the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Always split the data into train and test subsets first, particularly before any preprocessing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Never include test data when using the `fit` and `fit_transform` methods. Using all the data, e.g., `fit(X)`, can result in overly optimistic scores. Conversely, the `transform` method should be used on both train and test subsets as the same preprocessing should be applied to all the data. This can be achieved by using `fit_transform` on the train subset and `transform` on the test subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **scikit-learn pipeline** is a great way to prevent data leakage as it ensures that the appropriate method is performed on the correct data subset. The pipeline is ideal for use in cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning functions."
